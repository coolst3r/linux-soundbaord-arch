# Linxboard: The Soundboard for the Aware and the Anxious

Welcome to **Linxboard**, the only soundboard that gives you the power to fight back against the oppressive surveillance state! While you play your sounds, know that Big Brother is watching—but you’re armed with the truth and the right tools! 

## 🚨 WARNING: Use at Your Own Risk

This is not just a soundboard; it's a **statement**! While you're busy gaming or chilling with friends, remember: they’re always listening. From **XKeyscore** to **Vault 7**, the government is out to get you, and Windows is in bed with them! 

## 🔥 Features

- **Radically Customizable Interface**: Forget boring interfaces! Choose your own backgrounds and make the neon border pulsate like your heartbeat when you realize just how deep the rabbit hole goes. 
- **10 Sounds Max?**: Yeah, right! Make your selections wisely, because each sound is a weapon in your audio arsenal. Keep the laughs rolling or blast your opponents with epic sound bites. 
- **Profiles for the Paranoid**: Switch profiles faster than the government changes its surveillance tactics! Need a gaming setup? Or maybe something for those late-night conspiracies? We got you covered.
- **Key Bindings for Chaos**: Bind sounds to keys and launch them like digital grenades! Every keystroke is a small rebellion against the mainstream narrative. 
- **Volume Control**: Crank it up or turn it down; just remember—turning it down means the noise of the world can creep back in.
