To make this script work on Debian and Arch, you will need to install the GStreamer and GTK3 development libraries. Here is how you can do this:

Debian:

""  sudo apt-get update  ""
""  sudo apt-get install libgstreamer1.0-dev libgtk-3-dev  ""

Arch:

""   sudo pacman -Syu  ""
""  sudo pacman -S gstreamer gtk3  ""

Once you have installed the necessary libraries, you should be able to run the script on Debian and Arch.

""  python3 linxboard.py  ""

To use this script, save it to a file (e.g. dependencies.sh) and make it executable:
"" chmod +x dependencies.sh ""

Then, you can run the script with:

""  ./dependencies.sh  ""
