Here's how you can use the script:


    Open a text editor and paste the script into a new file.

    Save the file with a .sh extension, for example, install_requirements.sh.

    Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

    Make the script executable by running the following command: chmod +x install_requirements.sh.

    Run the script with root privileges by executing: sudo ./install_requirements.sh.
